## Instructions

- `git checkout -b <branchname>` the way I like doing it is `git checkout -b <yourname>/<feature>` so `git checkout -b tp/awsome-changes` Make sure you have no spaces

- `git status`

- `git add .` (this is for if you added new files it won't matter if you run anyways)

- `git commit -am "Commit Message"` Replace Commit Message with your message

- `git push` push to server
